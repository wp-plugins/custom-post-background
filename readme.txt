== Description ==

The Custom Post Background plugin for Wordpress adds a great deal of visual customization ability to your blog posts and page appearances. It allows you to easily change the background of individual blog posts/pages using CSS or an image URL (with or without a x/y/both repeat).
At the main menu, CPB lists all of your pages/posts and displays any background settings that are set. For any page, clicking on the edit button will open up a sub-menu with fields where you can then make your background customizations.

You can change the background with CSS/URL of image to apply to only the background of the post, only on the background of the home/main page, or both pages.
The "Color" feild option allows you to quickly make background changes using the background-color CSS code. You can enter any color (such as "red," "blue," "green") or enter a hex value, like: #A9A7A7. You can also change the whole page background (not just the post background) of any individual post with the "Display as page background on post page" option.
